# CSE212-final-project

Hello student! 

       This is my final project for CSE212. I will describe the following data structures:
* [Queue](1-queue.md)
* [Set](2-set.md)
* [Tree](3-tree.md)

    For each data structure I will include a description, a few python operations, a coding example, and a challange. See my [outline](outline.md) for specifics. 

Sincerly,

Emma Burkett
